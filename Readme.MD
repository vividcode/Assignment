# Assignment 

## **Assignment** repo consists of following folders within <your project root>:

- **idl**: This has `Map.djinni` which is source of truth for defining c++ and objective c interfaces. Follow [guidelines here](https://github.com/dropbox/djinni/blob/master/README.md).
- **djinni**: Clone of [Djinni](https://github.com/dropbox/djinni) - binding generator from Dropbox.
- **generated**: A folder generated past running Djinni command on .djinni file. (Will be cleaned up every time by **cmd.sh**). Will contain subfolders depending upon options supplied to `/djinni/src/run` within `cmd.sh`.
- **cpp**: Folder with concrete C++ subclasses of Djinni generated interfaces (contained in `generated\cpp`). Can exist anywhere. Content of this folder must be implemented past running djinni.
- **Client**: Folder for client Objective-C project

## `Client` folder structure:

Client folder holds `Client.xcodeproj`, which has groups of files added from `generated` as well `cpp` folders. 

- `cpp` folder at the root contains concrete C++ implementations of all interfaces generated by djinni within `generated\cpp` folder.
- `generated\objc` contains Objective C style interfaces. Concrete implementations of these must provide bridge code between client UI code (pure Objective-C: UIKit etc.) and classes within root `cpp` folder (pure C++)
- `generated\objcpp` is where .mm (Objective C++) files reside. They implement Objective-C interfaces contained within `generated\objc`.

## Steps to build entire project from scratch:

- Clone [this repo](https://github.com/vividcode/Assignment) into `<your project root>`. 
- Delete the `generated` folder.
- Clone [Djinni](https://github.com/dropbox/djinni) into `<your project root>\djinni`.
- Make desired changes to `idl/Map.djinni`. 
- Run `bash cmd.sh`.
- Add folders `generated`, `cpp`, and `djinni\support-libs` to `Client\Client.xcodeproj`.
- Build target `Client`.

## Steps to build from Git Repo directly:

Simply clone this repo, open `Client\Client.xcodeproj`, and build target `Client`.
